# [MapmyIndia](https://www.mapmyindia.com/api/)

### Get API key to access MapmyIndia (if you have an API key skip this)
#### Step 1: Get API Key
* Create an account to access [MapmyIndia API Dashboard](https://www.mapmyindia.com/api/dashboard)
* go to [signup/login](https://www.mapmyindia.com/api/login)

#### Step 2: Getting you key
* Once you are logged in, go to [MapmyIndia API Dashboard](https://www.mapmyindia.com/api/dashboard)
* You will be presented with different keys, the key that we are looking
  for is `REST API Key for Web/Android/iOS`

With this in place, make a GET request: https://apis.mapmyindia.com/advancedmaps/v1/#{KEY}/route_adv/driving/#{SOURCE[:longitude]},#{SOURCE[:latitude]};#{DESTINATION[:longitude]},#{DESTINATION[:latitude]}?geometries=polyline&overview=full

### Note:
* REQUEST should include `geometries` as `polyline` and `overview` as `full`.
* Setting overview as full sends us complete route. Default value for `overview` is `simplified`, which is an approximate (smoothed) path of the resulting directions.
* MapmyIndia accepts source and destination, as semicolon seperated

```ruby
require 'HTTParty'
require 'json'

# Source Details - New Delhi coordinates
SOURCE = { longitude: '77.18609677688849', latitude: '28.68932119156764' }
# Destination Details - Mumbai coordinates
DESTINATION = { longitude: '72.89902799500808', latitude: '19.092580173664984' }

# GET Request to MapmyIndia for Polyline
KEY = "wte1hgtcutid5zo5ayuyztrzytrjnilj"
BING_URL = "https://apis.mapmyindia.com/advancedmaps/v1/#{KEY}/route_adv/driving/#{SOURCE[:longitude]},#{SOURCE[:latitude]};#{DESTINATION[:longitude]},#{DESTINATION[:latitude]}?geometries=polyline&overview=full"
RESPONSE = HTTParty.get(BING_URL).body
json_parsed = JSON.parse(RESPONSE)

# Extracting polyline from JSON
mapmyindia_polyline = json_parsed['routes'].map { |x| x['geometry'] }.pop
```

Note:

We extracted the polyline for a route from MapmyIndia API

We need to send this route polyline to TollGuru API to receive toll information

## [TollGuru API](https://tollguru.com/developers/docs/)

### Get key to access TollGuru polyline API
* create a dev account to [receive a free key from TollGuru](https://tollguru.com/developers/get-api-key)
* suggest adding `vehicleType` parameter. Tolls for cars are different than trucks and therefore if `vehicleType` is not specified, may not receive accurate tolls. For example, tolls are generally higher for trucks than cars. If `vehicleType` is not specified, by default tolls are returned for 2-axle cars. 
* Similarly, `departure_time` is important for locations where tolls change based on time-of-the-day.

the last line can be changed to following

```ruby
# Sending POST request to TollGuru
TOLLGURU_URL = 'https://dev.tollguru.com/v1/calc/route'
TOLLGURU_KEY = ENV['TOLLGURU_KEY']
headers = {'content-type' => 'application/json', 'x-api-key' => TOLLGURU_KEY}
body = {'source' => "mapmyindia", 'polyline' => mapmyindia_polyline, 'vehicleType' => "2AxlesAuto", 'departure_time' => "2021-01-05T09:46:08Z"}
tollguru_response = HTTParty.post(TOLLGURU_URL,:body => body.to_json, :headers => headers)

```

The working code can be found in main.rb file.
