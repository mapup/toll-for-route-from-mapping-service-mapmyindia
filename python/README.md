# [MapmyIndia](https://www.mapmyindia.com/api/)

### Get API key to access MapmyIndia (if you have an API key skip this)
#### Step 1: Get API Key
* Create an account to access [MapmyIndia API Dashboard](https://www.mapmyindia.com/api/dashboard)
* go to [signup/login](https://www.mapmyindia.com/api/login)

#### Step 2: Getting you key
* Once you are logged in, go to [MapmyIndia API Dashboard](https://www.mapmyindia.com/api/dashboard)
* You will be presented with different keys, the key that we are looking
  for is `REST API Key for Web/Android/iOS`

With this in place, make a GET request:='https://apis.mapmyindia.com/advancedmaps/v1/{a}/route_adv/driving/{b},{c};{d},{e}?geometries=polyline&overview=full'.format(a=key,b=source_longitude,c=source_latitude,d=destination_longitude,e=destination_latitude)
### Note:
* REQUEST should include `geometries` as `polyline` and `overview` as `full`.
* Setting overview as full sends us complete route. Default value for `overview` is `simplified`, which is an approximate (smoothed) path of the resulting directions.
* MapmyIndia accepts source and destination, as semicolon seperated

```python
def get_polyline_from_mapmyindia(source_longitude,source_latitude,destination_longitude,destination_latitude):
    #Query MapmyIndia with Key and Source-Destination coordinates
    url='https://apis.mapmyindia.com/advancedmaps/v1/{a}/route_adv/driving/{b},{c};{d},{e}?geometries=polyline&overview=full'.format(a=key,b=source_longitude,c=source_latitude,d=destination_longitude,e=destination_latitude)
    
    #converting the response to json
    response=requests.get(url).json()
    
    #checking for errors in response 
    if str(response).find('message')>-1:
        raise Exception("{}: {} , check latitude,longitude perhaps".format(response['code'],response['message']))
    elif str(response).find('responsecode')>-1 and response['responsecode']=='401':
        raise Exception("{} {}".format(response['error_code'],response['error_description']))
    else:
        #Extracting polyline
        polyline_from_mapmyindia=response["routes"][0]['geometry']
        return(polyline_from_mapmyindia)
```

Note:

We extracted the polyline for a route from MapmyIndia API

We need to send this route polyline to TollGuru API to receive toll information

## [TollGuru API](https://tollguru.com/developers/docs/)

### Get key to access TollGuru polyline API
* create a dev account to [receive a free key from TollGuru](https://tollguru.com/developers/get-api-key)
* suggest adding `vehicleType` parameter. Tolls for cars are different than trucks and therefore if `vehicleType` is not specified, may not receive accurate tolls. For example, tolls are generally higher for trucks than cars. If `vehicleType` is not specified, by default tolls are returned for 2-axle cars. 
* Similarly, `departure_time` is important for locations where tolls change based on time-of-the-day.

the last line can be changed to following

```python
def get_rates_from_tollguru(polyline):
    #Tollguru querry url
    Tolls_URL = 'https://dev.tollguru.com/v1/calc/route'
    
    #Tollguru resquest parameters
    headers = {
                'Content-type': 'application/json',
                'x-api-key': Tolls_Key
                }
    params = {   
                # explore https://tollguru.com/developers/docs/ to get best off all the parameter that tollguru offers 
                'source': "here",
                'polyline': polyline ,         #  this is polyline that we fetched from the mapping service     
                'vehicleType': '2AxlesAuto',                #'''Visit https://tollguru.com/developers/docs/#vehicle-types to know more options'''
                'departure_time' : "2021-01-05T09:46:08Z"   #'''Visit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time to know the time format'''
                }
    
    #Requesting Tollguru with parameters
    response_tollguru= requests.post(Tolls_URL, json=params, headers=headers).json()
    
    #checking for errors or printing rates
    if str(response_tollguru).find('message')==-1:
        return(response_tollguru['route']['costs'])
    else:
        raise Exception(response_tollguru['message'])
```
